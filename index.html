Brief Description of Goal of Code:
I intend to code an app that can aid in diagnosing whether a patient is at risk for heart disease. With the emergence and accessibility of processed foods, negligence of proper physical exercise, and other unhealthy habits, more and more Americans face heart related issues as they age. 
 
Known Issues:
No known issues with developing the app. 
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
